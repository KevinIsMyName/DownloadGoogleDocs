# DownloadGoogleDocs

A short script that lets you download a Google Document in Python. I wrote this so that I don't have to manually download it every time I have a change to a document and instead automate it with a one-click script.

A lot of this code was copied from Google Drive API's official quickstart.py and modified for smy purposes.

You will need a credentials.json and token.pickle (generated from credentials.json)

I would highly recommend reading [this](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python) to learn more. It's straight from Google's Drive API.
